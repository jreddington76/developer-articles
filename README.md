# developer-articles

This project was created as a place for me to centralize all the notes I have made over the years.  These notes used to reside in txt files on my local machine which was not very useful!

So, the first reason for this repo to to centralize my notes.

Second reason is that I wanted to learn ReactJS and I find it much easier to learn a new technology whilst working on a project, rather than following some contrived tutorial.

OK, to get started clone the repo and run npm install

npm start will get you up and running in dev mode, using webpack-dev-server to bundle the content.

npm run build will create the bundle.js file.  Together with index.html, these 2 files can be added as the root of an IIS website.
